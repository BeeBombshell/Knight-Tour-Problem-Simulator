The Knight Tour Problem is a classical problem in the game of Chess. The idea is to make a knight piece trace each square in a n x n Chess board (conventionally n=8). The knight is supposed to trace with its defined move i.e., two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, somewhat trailing an L- shape.

The project aims to solve the Knight Tour Problem using the idea of tracing paths and circuit through a graph with a given set of vertices and edges and define an algorithm for the same.
